    "The Landsat program is a joint program between NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that has launched a sequence of Earth observation satellites (Landsat 1-9).  Originating in 1984, the Landsat program provides the [longest continuous observation of the Earth's surface](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZx1xmNGcXI?list=PLD240BBC85537B9BE). Take the time to monitor some of the fascinating [timelapses](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) using Landsat to showcase things like urban development, glacial retreat and deforestation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load a Landsat scene over our region of interest, inspect the units and plot the radiance. Specifically, use imagery from the Landsat 8, the most recent of the [sequence of Landsat satellites](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-8) (at the time of writing, Landsat 9 just launched and data is not yet available). \n",
    "\n",
    "To inspect a Landsat 8 image (also called a *scene*) in our region of interest (ROI), we can choose a point to center our map, filter the image collection to get a scene with few clouds, and display information about the image in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `geemap` visualization tool, we can inspect our images - In the top right of the map, click the wrench icon, and then the :information_source: (means instructor).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will specifically be using USGS Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 Raw Scenes - if you read the documentation, the values refer to scaled, calibrated at-sensor radiance. Tier 1 means it is ready for analysis and is the highest quality imagery. There's quite a bit to learn about how the Landsat data is processed - if you will be working with Landsat extensively, take the time to read the Data Users [Handbook](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-8-data-users-handbook) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will filter the `ImageCollection` by date (year 2014) and location (to the ROI, which for this exercise is Blacksburg, VA), sort by a metadata property included in the imagery called `CLOUD_COVER` and get the first image out of this sorted collection."

A common way to visualize images is to set the red band to display in red, the green band to display in green and the blue band to display in blue - just as you would create a normal photograph. This means trying to match the [spectral response of the instrument](http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=5779) to the spectral response of the photoreceptors in the human eye. It's not a perfect match but this is called a *true-color* image. When the display bands don't match human visual perception (as we will see later), the visualization is called a *false-color composite*. "

It should be apparent, especially if you chart the spectra, that the scale of pixel values in different bands is drastically different. Specifically, bands 10-11 are not in [0, 1].  The reason is that these are thermal bands, and are converted to brightness temperature, in Kelvin, as part of the TOA conversion. Very little radiance is reflected in this wavelength range; most is emitted from the Earth's surface. That emitted radiance can be used to estimate [brightness temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness_temperature) using the inverted [Planck equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck's_law).

Unravelling those effects is called atmospheric correction (\"compensation\" is probably a more accurate term) and is beyond our scope of this lab. However, most satellite imagery providers complete this correction for the consumers.
