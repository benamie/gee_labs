**Google Earth Engine Tutorials**

This code repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that are used as a framework for building real-world projects using Google Earth Engine using the Python API (with some examples using the JavaScript API). These labs are currently in use for the 'Remote Sensing in the Social Sciences' course (AAEC 5544) taught at Virginia Tech in the Fall of 2022 by Elinor Benami and Ozzy Campos. Students are encouraged to work with their local environment, but these labs are run on Google Colab.

For further questions, please email [Ozzy](aocampos@vt.edu) or [Elinor](elinor@vt.edu).
