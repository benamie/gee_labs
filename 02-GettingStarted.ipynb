    "Whether you use the JavaScript or Python API, you will have to sign-up for a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://signup.earthengine.google.com). Registration is free and straightforward, but it takes approximately 24 hours to be approved to use the code editor. \n",
    "\n",
    " * Note: use a personal email address instead of your .edu account, as the .edu settings will not let you access a project. This is a frequently-changing process and the guidelines will likely change. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the account is approved, you can access Google Earth Engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "With JavaScript, you can get started immediately - as long as you are logged into Google with the account you created your account with, you can access the [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com) immediately and start running scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python takes a little more effort to set up - you have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the Earth Engine library (one-time per environment)\n",
    "2. Authenticate your Earth Engine Account (one-time per environment)\n",
    "3. Initiate the API (Every time you run a script)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will be using the [`geemap`](https://geemap.org) package for visualization in conjunction with Earth Engine, install instructions are also included.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Python Package Installation - Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab already has the Earth Engine library installed. You will have to install libraries that are not natively supported for the scripts you run each time. In the example below, we are using `pip` (a package and environment manager, similar to Anaconda) to ensure that your libraries are installed correctly. With Colab you will have to complete this step each time you start working with a notebook - ensure that it's in a code chunk at the top of your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the long-term, it would benefit you to learn how to set up your local environment, as you have control over your work. There are some resources in the 'Local Environment' section of this course that may help get you started.  \n",
