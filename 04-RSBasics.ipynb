    "#### Extension to Geospatial Imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial imagery poses two additional complications on top of a traditional color photograph. For analysis, we need to be able to tie our imagery to the real world. In the image of peppers, each pixel was built on an arbitrary axis of rows and columns that start at zero. However, this gives us no meaningful information about where in the world the red bell pepper is located. With geospatial imagery, we need to associate pixels with location. We need to know the exact size of the pixel, and position on earth. The high-resolution imagery below is produced by the 'National Agriculture Imagery Program'. This imagery has a red, green and blue value and a latitude and longitude (-74.01, 40.72), in addition to a size (each pixel represents 1 meter by 1 meter). With this information, we can associate our pixel values with location on earth (New York), and aggregate the information we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Pixel Location](https://github.com/ghidora77/03_GEE_Labs_DSPG/blob/main/im/im_01_04.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The other complexity we are faced with is that satellite imagery often has many layers. While our image of peppers had only a red, green and blue value, many satellite platforms are equipped to provide much more information. Most platforms have a value in the near infra-red range - while others have numerous bands, with different scales and resolutions. For instance, the Landsat 8 sensor has eleven bands capturing information from eleven different portions of the electromagentic spectrum, including near infrared (NIR) and thermal bands that are invisible to the human eye. Many Machine Learning projects, which we will explore in later labs, involve normalizing or transforming the information contained within each of these layers. Note that while each pixel size must be the same within each individual layer, the layers can be different. For instance, a satellite platform may have 5 meter spatial resolution in the red/green/blue range, but 60m resolution in the near infra-red range. While visualizing satellite imagery as a traditional photograph is a good starting point, there's much more information that we can incorporate into our analysis. We often build false or pseudocolor images by utilizing different combintions of bands, or we can focus in on certain infrared signatures to detect asphalt roads and roofs. The possibilities of analysis within remote sensing are endless, but this also leads to complications. \n",

    "### From Digital Image to Geospatial Image\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the connection between our satellite imagery and real-world location even more complicated is the fact that a digital image is a flat, square surface - the earth is spherical. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make use remote sensing imagery, we need to align the pixels in our image to a real-world location. There's quite a bit of mathematics involved in this process, but we will focus on two main components - establishing a Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) and a Projected Coordinate System (PCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GCS defines the spherical location of the image whereas the PCS defines how the grid around that location is constructed. Because the earth is not a perfect sphere, there are different GCS for different regions, such as 'North American Datum: 83' which is used to accurately define North America, and 'World Geodetic System of 1984', which is used globally. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PCS then constructs a flat grid around the GCS to create a relationship between each pixel of a 2-dimensional image to the corresponding area on the world. Some of the common PCS formats include EPSG, Albers Conic, Lambert, Eckert, Equidistant, etc. Different types of PCS's are designed for different use cases, as the needs of a petroleum engineer working over a few square miles will differ from than a climate change researcher measuring global change. Much of the discussion of defining GCS is outside the scope of this course, but the important thing to note is that a GCS defines the starting point for a projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESRI has an [article](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/) discussing the difference between GCS and PCS that provides further context on this relationship. While you should be aware of these two major terms - especially when you intend to run analysis on the data you download from GEE in another system, such as R, Python, or ArcGIS - GEE takes care of much of the complexity of these differences behind the scenes. Further documentation on the GEE methodology can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections). In our first exercise, we will show you how to identify the PCS so you can understand the underlying structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the bands available in your datasets, identifying which bands are necessary (and appropriate) for your analysis, and ensuring that these data represent consistent spatial locations is essential. While GEE simplifies many complex calculations behind the scenes, this lab will help us unpack the products available to us and their essential characteristics."

There are also large global products that have spatial resolution in the kilometers. The key point in dealing with spatial resolution is ensuring that your analysis drives your data collection, as there are tradeoffs involved. Using high resolution imagery can be expensive, both monetarily and computationally, if conducting continent wide analysis. Yet using low-resolution imagery will not be effective if your use case necessitates identifying individual buildings or small vehicles. Understanding the appropriate spatial resolution needed for your analysis is essential, and is why there are different platforms that focus on different spatial resolutions.\n",

Historically, satellites have been large, solitary objects that had to make tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution - MODIS measures wide swathes of land with each sweep, and has relatively high temporal resolution. Landsat has improved spatial resolution but a revisit rate of 16 days, and NAIP is aggregated either annually or bi-annually. Over the past decade, satellite technology has improved and there is more diversity in mission sets. Cube satellites are small, shoe-box sized satellites that can provide both high-resolution imagery and, when mosaiced together, provide high temporal resolution as well. The tradeoff is that these satellites do not have the same array of sophisticated sensors that larger satellites are equipped with. Other satellites, such as those run by the intelligence community and private satellite companies, are designed for rapid revisit times of certain cities or political areas while not scanning the rest of the world. \n",

One thing to keep in mind is that while sensors have developed and become more sensitive / accurate, capable of recording collecting data in upwards of 16 bits, that may not necessarily be beneficial for your work. Computation and storage costs grow, and normalizing the data to 8-bit values to work with tools such as OpenCV defeats the purpose of this sensitive colllection rate. There are use cases where high bit rate collection makes sense (e.g., looking for a very narrow range in a custom spectral range to identify mineral deposits), but ensure that you understand where and why higher radiometric resolution is necessary.

    "Now that we have some familiarity with higher quality images, lets look at a few from the (broken) Landsat 7 satellite. Using your downloading skills, now select an image that contains the Blacksburg area with minimal cloud cover from Landsat 7 (for now, using the Collection 1 Tier 1 calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data product). Look at the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the obvious (hint: post-2003) problem with the Landsat 7 image? What is the nature of that problem and what have some researchers done to try to correct it? (please research online in addition to using what you have learned in class/from the book)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name three major changes you can view in the Blacksburg Area in the last decade using any of the above imagery (and state the source).\n",

    "Conduct a search to compare the technical characteristics of the following sensors:\n",

    "* MODIS (NASA) versus Sentinel (ESA)\n",
    "* AVHRR (NASA) versus IRS-P6 (or choose another Indian Remote Sensing satellite)\n",

    "1. Based on the characteristics you describe, for which applications is one sensor likely to be more suitable than the other ones?\n",
